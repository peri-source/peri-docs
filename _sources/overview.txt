Architecture overview
=====================

In order to facilitate adding new models and adapting the included models to
new types of microscopes, we will describe here the basic structure of PERI the
Python package. 

The goal of PERI is to compare (and ultimately fit) a model to a set of data,
usually images from a microscope. If the noise in the image is Gaussian
distributed then this problem reduces to a least-squares optimization comparing
our synthetic image to the data, :math:`\rm{min}_{\sigma} \sum_i | M(\sigma)_i
- I_i |^2` where :math:`M(\sigma)_i` is the model image of parameters
:math:`\sigma` at pixel :math:`i` and :math:`I_i` is the corresponding data
pixel.
